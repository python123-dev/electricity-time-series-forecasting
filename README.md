# Electricity Consumption Forecasting using LSTM and Attention

This project implements multivariate time series forecasting on household
electricity consumption data using deep learning models.

## Models Implemented
- Dense Neural Network (baseline)
- LSTM
- LSTM with Temporal Attention

## Dataset
- Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset
- Source: UCI / Kaggle
- Time resolution: Minute-level
- Features: Global active power, voltage, sub-metering values, etc.

## Evaluation
- Metric: RMSE
- LSTM outperformed Dense baseline
- Attention mechanism improved interpretability
